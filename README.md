# CompareBox
CompareBox repository for the StartupBox programme hosted by Startup Village.

CompareBox is a windows forms application that lets users compare the similarity of any two images in the internet, and get the result in a range of 0 (very diffrent) - 100 (exactly same). Users can upload two images in the internet through their links.
